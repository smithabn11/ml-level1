    "Python library is a collection of functions and methods that lets you perform lots of actions without writing your own code [reference](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Python-library-and-what-can-I-use-it-for). In this lab we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **scipy**: SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. \n",
    "- **numpy**: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "- **matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms\n",
    "- **pandas**:  Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. \n",
    "- **sklearn**: Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification/regression (supervised) and clustering (unsupervised) algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Training: Now you have dataset and machine learning algorithm selected. In training step, you can build a model that makes use of a given algorithm to learn the output from your data. This model can be saved for predicting the output on a new data point. \n",
    "Before we start training typically we split the dataset into training and validation sets. Only training set is used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluation: Once training is complete, it’s time to see if the model is any good, using Evaluation. We will use validation set to measure accuracy and see how well our trained model is able to do a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Parameter Tuning: Once you’ve done evaluation, it’s possible that you want to see if you can further improve your training in any way. We can do this by tuning our parameters. There were a few parameters we implicitly assumed when we did our training, and now is a good time to go back and test those assumptions and try other values.\n"
