    "## Python Libraries\n",
    "Python library is a collection of functions and methods that lets you perform lots of actions without writing your own code [reference](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Python-library-and-what-can-I-use-it-for). In this lab we will use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **scipy**: SciPy is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing. \n",
    "- **numpy**: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "- **matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms\n",
    "- **pandas**:  Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. \n",
    "- **sklearn**: Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification/regression (supervised) and clustering (unsupervised) algorithms.\n",

    "Machine learning (ML) describes algorithms that look at data and correct output for that data and learn from it.\n",
    "An ML program will try to learn the relationship between input data and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning program:\n",
    "1. May extract the features of the dataset (e.g., shape or color) for a given problem (e.g., separating apples and oranges); or we will explicitly define the features.\n",
    "2. Uses the observed features and correct output (also called 'labels') to learn the results (e.g., it is an apple or it is an orange).\n",
    "3. Saves the observed results as a machine learning model for later use.\n",
    "4. Uses the saved results in the machine learning model to predict the output for a new data instance (is this an apple or an orange?)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a feature in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. For example, an apple is red, green, or pink.  A banana is yellow.  An apple is round.  A banana is oblong and tapered at the ends. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Gathering Data: Collect data along with its required attributes and the output you are expecting to solve your problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Data preparation: In this step, we load our data into a suitable place and prepare it for use in our machine learning training. Sometimes the data we collect needs other forms of adjusting, manipulation, and cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choosing a model: There are many machine learning algorithms readily available to try out. In general, figure out a category of algorithms that suit your problem. Then you can try them on your dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Training: Now you have dataset and machine learning algorithm selected. In training step, you can build a model that makes use of a given algorithm to learn the output from your data. This model can be saved for predicting the output on a new data point. \n",
    "Before we start training typically we split the dataset into training and validation sets. Only training set is used for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluation: Once training is complete, it’s time to see if the model is any good, using Evaluation. We will use validation set to measure accuracy and see how well our trained model is able to do a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Parameter Tuning: Once you’ve done evaluation, it’s possible that you want to see if you can further improve your training in any way. We can do this by tuning our parameters. There were a few parameters we implicitly assumed when we did our training, and now is a good time to go back and test those assumptions and try other values.\n"
